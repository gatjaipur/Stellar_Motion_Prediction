Stellar Motion

Learn about the star by examining the light coming from it. Using Diffraction grating, split light into different wavelengths. Measure intensity of light at their individual wavelengths give the stars characteristic spectrums. 

For most stars the intensity is low and their wavelength is noticeably at 650 nm because hydrogen which is major component of most stars absorb light at 656.3 nm and therefore at this wavelength the plot refers this point to hydrogen alpha line. 

If star is moving away from the sun then its' hydrogen alpha line(lowest point) is after the 656.3 nm mark (redshifted) (shifted rightwards)  and if star is moving towards sun then it's hydrogen alpha line is before 656.6 nm mark (blueshifted) (shifted leftwards)

We can compare observed wavelength of hydrogen alpha line to known one to determine how fast the star is moving away from Earth.

Astronomers use this technique to measure precise oscillations demonstrating presence of planets in space.
